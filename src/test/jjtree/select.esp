# Create stream
create stream s1 (a int, b float, c string, d timestamp) from source adv;

# Create relation
create relation r1 (a int, b float, c string, d timestamp) from source adv;

# Basic select
select * from s1;
select a, s.b as sb from s1 as s;

# Projection with expression
select (a+3)/2, b*c from s1;

# Where clause
select a, b from s1 where s1.a = 3;

# Aggregate, group by
select a, avg(b), sum(b) from s1 where d = 1 group by a, d;

# Window
# select a, b from s1[a=3].win_length(3);

# join
select s.b, r.c from s1 as s, r1 as r where s.a=r.a and (s.b=3 or s.d=4);
